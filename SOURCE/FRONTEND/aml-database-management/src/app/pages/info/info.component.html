  The AML-NoSQL-Database-Management is used to upload AML files onto a NoSQL-Database to provide a
  unified and central solution to manage AML files.
<br>AML is a file format developed as an exchange format with an open standard.
<br>From the user's point of view, the GUI should have the following functionalities:
<ol>
  <li>Upload AML files from the user's computer.</li>
  <li>Download files to the computer that have been uploaded.</li>
  <li>Edit saved files with a dialog window and upload the changed version.</li>
  <li>Delete saved files from a list of files.</li>
  <li>Search for existing AML files with the file name.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Navigation Bar</h1>

    <br>
    <h1>Main page</h1>
    Let's move to the most important part of the website: the main site.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neumainpage.png" alt="mainpage" />
    <br>
    Here you can find the heart of our software: the AML NoSQL Database. Starting on the upper right
    side you can find two buttons:
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/uploadcreate.png" alt="uploadcreate" />
    <br>
    Both are used to get add new AML files into the AML NoSQL-Database.
    <br><br><h2>Uploading a file</h2>
    The left button which sais 'Upload' is used to upload .aml files from your computer.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/upload.png" alt="upload" />
    <br>
    If you click this button you should see a little popup which sais 'Upload file.
    Here you can upload your AML file.'.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/uploadaltert.png" alt="uploadalert" />
    <br>
    Under this texts on the left you can see a little button
    with 'Choose File'. Right next to the button on the right side is an info text to show your
    upload status. By default it sais 'No file chosen'. In the bottom right corner you will see two
    buttons. The left one sais 'Cancel' and can be used to abort the upload process. The right one
    which is greyed and blocked by default sais 'Upload'. To make use of the upload button, you have
    to press the 'Choose File' button first. Pressing it will open your local file system. You can
    now search your local file system for files you want to upload. Just select them and press
    confirm. How exactly your file system as well as the confirmation process looks depoends
    on your used Operation-System. 
    After you have selected a file you will see that your selected file is shown at the spot, where
    'No file chosen' stood before.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/uploadselected.png" alt="uploadselected" />
    <br>
    Use this to make sure you have chosen the right file. If you are certain that you selected everything
    correctly, you can finally press the 'Uplaod' button. You will be redirected to the main page
    and the selected file will be uploaded. Make sure you see a little altert box at the bottom of the site
    which sais 'File was uploaded succesfully'.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neuuploadsucces.png" alt="uploadsucces" />
    <br>
    Note that it is not possible to upload files which have the same name like an already existing
    one.
    <br>
    <br><br><h2>Creating a file</h2>
    Alternatively you can also choose to make use of the 'Create file' button.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/createfilebutton.png" alt="createfilebutton" />
    <br>
    As the name sais, it is used to create .aml files directly in the AML-NoSQL Database. Clicking
    it will also show you an alert box which looks very similar to the one where you can upload.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neucreatefile.png" alt="createfile" />
    <br>
    Like in the upload process there are 'Cancel' and 'Upload' buttons with the same functionallities as in the upload process.
    This time you have an input line which sais 'Name'. Use this to declare a name but keep in mind to choose a unique name because
    otherwise you will get an error. As you can see on the
    right side of the inputline, you dont have to to write .aml as file type. The software does this
    automatically for you. The big Textfield down under is used to write code for your .aml file. It
    even supports syntax highlighting. When you are done writing you can confirm by clicking the
    'Upload' button.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neucreatecode.png" alt="createfilecode" />
    <br>
    You will be redirected to the main page and your file will appear at the table. Again make sure that you see the 
    little alert box that tells you that the creation was succesfull.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neucreatesuccess.png" alt="createdfilesuccessfully" />
    <br>
    <br><br><h2>Finding a file</h2>
    When you have uploaded several files to the database, finding specific items can get difficult.
    To help you finding the files you are searching for, AML-NoSQL provides a searchbar on the left
    top of the Database to specify filterwords.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/filterbox.png" alt="filterbox" />
    <br>
    You can type all kinds of keywords for example numbers to search for the date, ID or size or
    type characters to search for the name of the file. A combination of numbers and characters is
    possible as well.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neufilterdemo.png" alt="searchdemonstrate" />
    <br>
    Therefore you will be able to filter out files with attributes you don't want.
    <br>
    <h1>Using the Table</h1>
    The table is the heart of the main page. All uploaded .aml files will appear here.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neutable.png" alt="table" />
    <br>
    <br><br><h2>Sorting files</h2>
    In order to find them easier you can sort the table. Therefore you shall use the sort bar.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/sortbar.png" alt="sortbar" />
    <br>
    To do this, just press one of the categories at the table header. You can filter ascending or
    descending by either 'ID', which is an identifier given by the software to identify uploaded
    files, Name, which is the name you have chosen for your file, 'Size', which is the size of your
    created file and 'Date', which is the date of creation (not upload!) of your file. To switch
    between ascending and descending just click the attribute of choise once again.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/idascending.png" alt="idascending" />
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/iddescending.png" alt="iddescending" />
    <br>
    By clicking it a third time you can stop sorting.
    <br><br><h2>Edit, delete or delete a file</h2>
    The item on the right side of the table header sais 'Actions'.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/actions.png" alt="actions" />
    <br>
    Here you can delete, download or edit files. To edit a file you must click the pencil symbol.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/editfile.png" alt="editfile" />
    <br>
    You will then be redirected to a alertbox which looks like the 'Create file' one. You can now
    change the name and edit the code of the file. Of course you can 'Cancel' the operation if you
    dont want to do any changes. If you are done editing just press 'Upload'.
    <br>
    <br>
    The second option is
    to Download files.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/downloadfile.png" alt="downloadfile" />
    <br>
    If you wish to download a specific file to your PC, you shall click on the down pointing arrow. The download will start automatically.
    <br>
    <br>
    The
    last option is to delete files. To delete a file press the dustbin button.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/deletefile.png" alt="deletefile" />
    <br>
    To make sure you do not delete a file on accident, you will get a second instance confirmation
    before the file is deleted.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/suredelete.png" alt="suredelete" />
    <br>
    You will have to press 'OK' to confirm the deletion process.
    <br>
    <br><br><h2>Paging</h2>
    At the bottom right corner you can see the paging operations.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/neumanyfiles.png" alt="manyfiles" />
    <br>
    For reasons of user experience and performance only 10 items are shown per page.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/defaultitemsperpage.png" alt="defaultitemsperpage" />
    <br>
    Anyways you can set this number up tp 200. Just click on the number right next to 'Items per
    page' ans select your number of choice.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/filespersite.png" alt="filespersite" />
    <br>
    On the right side of this selection you can see the amount of items which are shown per page.
    Last but not least in the right corner you can see two arrows.
    <br>
    <img id="image" src="assets/images/manual/pagearrow.png" alt="pagearrow" />
    <br>
    You can use them to navigate between multiple table pages so you dont have to show too many
    items per page.
    <br>
