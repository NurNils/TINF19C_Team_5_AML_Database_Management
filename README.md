## About the project

The project was developed by DHBW students in the 3rd semester during the lecture Software Engineering.
The main purpose of the software will be to upload AutomationML files to a database. The uploaded files can be accessed from the user through a web interface. In that interface the user is also able to edit, delete and download existing files. He should also have the ability to search for saved documents. This provides the user with an easy way to upload AutomationML files into a database and conveniently handle them through a web interface.
